# Game of Life 2D Implementation

**Cellular Automata Project**

Currently the program models a cellular automata where the user can specify: size, rule used, initial states, and the amount of "steps" the CA (cellular automata) goes through.
The program displays a simulation of each cell in the CA processing a specified rule.

_**UPDATED**_

As of November 2021,
The program now supports a 2D array simulation of Conway's Game of Life. The user can input as many "steps" as they choose by pressing enter and the console will display the simulation for each step.

The program has methods for a 1D array as well, but the main program will not simulate this currently.



**Special Notes**

1: Represents "alive" cells

0: Represents "dead" cells

**NOTE TO TA'S:** I've tested my program on Ubuntu using terminal and the code works fine, I'm not sure why it doesn't work on the pyrite server.
