**CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE SIMULATOR IN C++**

_Graphics Client (GraphicsClient.cpp and GraphicsClient.h)_

    Allows the user to interact with a graphics server, supplied by my professor. Features of the graphics client include: 

    1. Setting background color
    2. Set drawing color
    3. Draw/fill rectangles 
    4. Draw/fill ovals
    5. Set a pixel at a location
    6. Draw a line
    7. Write a string 
    8. Create a "file browser" for the user to select specific text files.
    
    The code is written in a way that interacts with the graphics server through formats given by the instructor, 
    a series of "messages" are used and sent to the graphics server using c sockets. Each feature is accessed by using 
    a code recognized by the server and the specific details of how the feature should display is chosen by the programmer.
    For example, the programmer specifies length(5), width(4), position(1,2) and then uses a code to send to the server, a 
    rectangle will be created at location (1,2) and will have dimensions of length(5) and width(4).

_Cellular Automaton Model (CellularAutomaton.cpp and CellularAutomaton.h)_

    Creates a model of a 2-D cellular automaton object that is used in conjunction with the graphics client and server. The 
    program is structured so a user can specify a grid in the format: Rows, Columns, Grid layout in a text file. The program will
    create a model of a cellular automaton given these parameters. There is a function called "step" which will model a simulation 
    of one step of a certain rule on the cellular automaton model, as of now, only Conway's Game of Life is included with the program.
    The last function that is included is a "display" function which will display the current state of a cellular automaton model to
    the graphics server provided. The "display" function works in tandem with GraphicsClient.cpp. For the present implementation, 
    "alive" states are modeled by a solid square, and "dead" states are modeled by a hollow square. Cell size and cell gap are hard 
    coded. 
_Cellular Automaton Simulation (casimulator.cpp)_

    Creates a GUI that is designed by me given by the tools of the graphics client. The buttons are created so that whenever the 
    correct position is clicked (location is given by the graphics server) the correct action will be performed on the left side of the
    GUI. Whenever pressed with the exception of "RUN", the buttons will flash a color to indicate is has been clicked on. The "RUN" 
    button will remain green if pressed and the simulation is currently running. Pressing "PAUSE" will stop the ongoing simulation and 
    "RUN" will go back to it's original color. "LOAD" will open a file browser and the selected text file's properties will be shown 
    on the GUI. "RESET" will reset the simulation back to it's original state from when "LOAD" was performed. "CLEAR" will make the
    left side of the GUI blank, setting each cell to state 0. The "RANDOM" button randomly assigned each cell state to be either dead 
    or alive. The code includes a "toggle" logic which lets the user change the state of any desired cell from dead to alive or alive 
    to dead. The simulation will run based on these updated toggled values.



**CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE IN C**

The code follows these sets of rules for the Game of Life for each simulation: 
- _Any live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors surive._
- _Any dead cell with 3 or more neighbors become a dead cell._
- _Otherwise, cells will die in the next iteration._

Neighbors are the numbers around a cell at location (x,y) in the array presented in the console. 

Wrapping logic is included in the code.

**KNOWN BUGS**
- Selecting size 1 to 2 or 3 will cause the program to crash. The opposite should work.
- "RUN" button and "PAUSE" will sometimes remain on the "pressed" color state, slowing down the time between clicks will help prevent this.
