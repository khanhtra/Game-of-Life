**CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE IN C**

The code follows these sets of rules for the Game of Life for each simulation: 
- _Any live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors surive._
- _Any dead cell with 3 or more neighbors become a dead cell._
- _Otherwise, cells will die in the next iteration._

Neighbors are the numbers around a cell at location (x,y) in the array presented in the console. 

Wrapping logic is included in the code.

**How to simulate a pattern from the Game of Life** : 

Set specific locations according to the desired pattern, the program will output a 2D array displaying the current state after x amount of times.
